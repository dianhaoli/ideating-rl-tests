# LOG: append-only lab notebook (orchestrator + cross-task entries)

Per-task notebooks: `tasks/<name>/NOTES.md` (each one is timestamped and append-only). Concurrent builders work on
separate branches, so their detailed entries live there to avoid merge conflicts. This file records cross-task
events, orchestration decisions and gate summaries, with links.

- Machine inspected. The plan says AWS g5 (A10G 24 GB), but the machine has **1x NVIDIA L4 (23 GB)**, 30 GB RAM,
  8 vCPU and about 83 GB of free disk on /. torch 2.13+cu130 is in /opt/pytorch (Python 3.13). I installed transformers 5.18,
  peft 0.21, accelerate 1.15 and datasets 5.0 there.
- HF token: Dan pasted it mid-session. Stored at ~/.hf_env and $HF_HOME/token with mode 600, outside the repo.
  Verified (whoami OK) without printing it. Access confirmed for gemma-2-2b, gemma-scope-2b-pt-res, Qwen2.5-0.5B/1.5B and
  gemma-3-270m.
- Repo github.com/dianhaoli/ideating-rl-tests was empty. No GitHub credentials on the machine, so **push is impossible
  for now**. Committing locally; logged in OPEN_QUESTIONS.
- EditHunt repo: **not present on this machine** (searched the filesystem). So wave-1 task 5 (T2-Families) is skipped as
  the plan specifies. A from-scratch hop-separation task goes into ideation as a candidate (see DECISIONS).
- Containment: I tried Tier A (a custom test-agent type whose hook forces every shell command to run as a
  low-privilege OS user). The Claude Code auto-mode classifier blocked it as self-modification of Claude Code
  config. Falling back to **Tier B: honor-system with auditing** (canaries, leak scanner, transcript audit). Dan can
  enable Tier A later (see OPEN_QUESTIONS).
- Started the background model/SAE download (common/download_models.py, log ~/hf_home/download.log).
- Wrote common/gpuq.py (GPU admission queue), docs/HARNESS_API.md (harness contract) and docs/BUILDER_GUIDE.md.
